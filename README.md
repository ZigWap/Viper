Viper
=====


Viper is an experimental general purpose high-level programming language.

Goals
-----

Some of the goals I have in mind is:

- Simple, the language should be simple
- Easy, the language should feel as easy as a scripting language
- Native, the language should run on the hardware itself
- Portable, the language should be translatable to multiple platforms.
- Expose hardware features in a portable way.
- Provide an extensive set of modules to allow the creation of applications 

Implementation
--------------

This current implementation is designed to support GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac,
with the long-term plan of supporting Android, iOS, and Windows Phones.
